#   description: "I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics as the University of
#   California, Los Angeles. While there, I worked in the lab of Dr. Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami studying pandemic potential
#   virus pathogenesis, and completed a thesis project focused on studying viral genetic adaptation to innate immune responses
#   such as cGAS-STING in Monkeypox outbreaks. After graduation, I joined the Corces Lab to learn more about and focus on the
#   fields of epigenetics and neurodegenerative diseases. Outside of lab, I spend most of my time reading and attempting to
#   finish writing a novel."
