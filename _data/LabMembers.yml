  description: "<p>I earned my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from MIT with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. During this time, I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of <a href='https://langerlab.mit.edu' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>Dr. Robert Langer</strong></a> and <a href='https://profiles.ucsf.edu/rajiv.saigal' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>Dr. Rajiv Saigal</strong></a>. We explored how conductive polymers could mitigate neuronal damage following excitotoxic injuries. These experiences provided foundational training in biomedical research and quantitative methods, and motivated me to continue research during my medical training.</p>
  
  <p>I therefore joined the lab of <a href='https://saltzmanlab.yale.edu' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>Dr. Mark Saltzman's</strong></a> while completing my medical education at Yale School of Medicine. We designed both systemic and topical nanoparticle platforms for <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat4422' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>preventative</strong></a> and <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25112935/' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>therapeutic</strong></a> applications in cancer treatment. Following medical school, I moved to Stanford to complete my residency, fellowship, and Ph.D. in Hematology and Cancer Biology. Under the guidance of <a href='https://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html' target='_blank'><strong style='color:#404040ff'>Dr. Ravi Majeti</strong></a>, I built a framework for studying healthy and malignant hematopoiesis using single cell multi-omics, and identified new multipotent progenitor cell populations in normal hematopoiesis and high-risk leukemia stem cells in acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
  
  <p>As the principal investigator of the Asiri Lab, we are further developing these methods by integrating single-cell technologies, computational biology, machine learning, and functional hematology to investigate the complexities of both normal and malignant blood cell development.</p>"

  description: "I grew up in Seattle, Toronto, Kochi (Japan), and all over California. I stayed in California to complete my bachelor’s degree in Statistical Data Science with a minor in Mathematics at UC Davis. During my undergrad, I joined Dr. Stefan Keller’s lab at UC Davis Veterinary Medicine where we developed methods to turn messy clinical data into clinician-ready tools. I automated a pipeline to parse, normalize, and validate veterinary lab data to produce clinical reports, reducing manual prep time. Additionally, I helped develop unsupervised machine learning models for clinical decision support which are now being used by veterinarians to assist diagnosis and prognostication of dog and equine diseases. Also during my undergrad, I interned as a Product Manager on Stanford Medicine’s MyHealth (patient portal) team, analyzing EHR, usage data, and patient surveys to improve patient experience and care delivery through MyHealth. During this time, I had the opportunity to join Dr. Jonathan H. Chen’s lab. Under his mentorship I contributed to the “Science & Medicine” chapter in the 2025 AI Index, focusing on LLM integration in clinical workflows and the role of social determinants of health in model performance and fairness. In the Asiri Lab, I am excited to apply my skills in data science and machine learning to build new clinical prediction systems for patients with myeloid malignancies. Outside of the lab, I like to go swimming in the summer, skiing in the winter, and watercolor paint year-round."

  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area and earned my Bachelor of Science at UC Santa Barbara, where I double majored in Statistics & Data Science and Biochemistry-Molecular Biology. As an undergraduate, I explored RNA regulation using a functional variant of CRISPR, gaining hands-on wet lab experience and becoming familiar with a wide range of molecular biology techniques. I later pursued a Master of Science in Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University to strengthen my foundation in computer science and pivot toward computational research. There, my work focused on optimizing the performance of a Hypergraphlet Counter through parallel programming in C++ and designing a Python-based sequence generator for synthetic intrinsically disordered proteins. Outside of research, I enjoy reading and playing bridge. In the Asiri Lab, I am excited to apply my computational skills to study blood development using single cell lineage tracing."

  description: "I'm currently a junior at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Systems. I grew up in Orange County, California, where I first learned how to code. Since coming to Stanford, I've become passionate about applying AI to real-world systems that leverage big data—particularly in healthcare, where I've been working on using large language models (LLMs) to process and analyze unstructured data. In my free time, I'm an active member of aKDPhi, Stanford's Asian-interest sorority, and I love going on long walks and exploring nature. In the Asiri Lab, I'm developing computational tools that use LLMs to interrogate large datasets in both healthy and malignant hematopoiesis"
