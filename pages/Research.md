		<p style="font-size:14px;margin-top:10px">
			The human blood system and its influence on health and disease is highly complex. Our blood consists of a diverse array of cell types that arise from a <strong style="color:#404040ff">hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)</strong> through a tightly regulated process known as hematopoiesis. Proper functioning of the blood system is essential for maintaining overall health, as blood cells play critical roles in oxygen transport, immune defense, and tissue repair. Dysregulation of hematopoiesis can lead to a variety of blood disorders, including anemia, immunodeficiencies, and hematologic malignancies. Understanding the intricate processes governing hematopoiesis is crucial for developing effective therapies for these conditions, especially in the aging population.

		<p>In the Asiri Lab, we study hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasms in adult humans. Myeloid neoplasms are heterogenous, clonal disorders arising from the malignant transformation of healthy <strong style="color:#404040ff">hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)</strong>. The heterogeneity is due to the underlying clonal diversity of the disease and the variable functional properties of these clones. Therefore, it is not surprising that myeloid neoplasms have been historically described as syndromes with mostly ineffective treatment strategies. The inability to completely characterize the cellular architecture of myeloid neoplasms and link it to outcomes has limited our ability to manage and cure patients. Recent advancements in single cell technologies [<strong style="color:#404040ff"><a href = "/pdfs/2023_blood_review.pdf">Ediriwickrema et al. <em>Blood</em> 2023</a></strong>] (Figure 1) can provide methods for addressing these limitations by allowing researchers to characterize blood cells with high resolution. However, as the field of single cell genomics expands at unprecedented rates, it is increasingly important to develop a rigorous framework for interpreting and validating important single cell observations with orthogonal computational and functional studies to provide meaningful services for patients. We have developed such a framework for studying normal and malignant hematopoiesis which has allowed us to identify new HSPCs in adult hematopoiesis [<strong style="color:#404040ff"><a href = "/pdfs/2025_MPP.pdf">Ediriwickrema et al. <em>Cell Reports</em> 2025</a></strong>] (Figure 2), and clinically high-risk <strong style="color:#404040ff">leukemia stem cells (LSCs)</strong> in <strong style="color:#404040ff">adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</strong> at high resolution.</p>

            <p>We are now using this framework and the cancer stem cell model to develop an integrative, multi-domain framework (Figure 3) for studying healthy and malignant hematopoiesis, with the long-term goal of designing more effective disease monitoring and treatment strategies for patients.</p>
            <p>Specifically, we will answer several important questions using the cancer stem cell model as a reference. First, how do <strong style="color:#404040ff">cancer stem cells (CSCs)</strong> emerge from healthy HSPCs, and can we identify features that distinguish CSCs from <strong style="color:#404040ff">preleukemic HSCs (pHSCs)</strong> and healthy HSPCs (Project 1)? Can we use this framework to study CSCs across other myeloid neoplasms (Project 2)? Finally, can we use this information to improve clinical disease monitoring assays and develop CSC targeted therapies to cure patients (Project 3)?</p>

        <div class="col-sm-7" style="text-align: justify">
			<p>Identifying CSCs, pHSCs, and healthy HSPCs first requires single cell genotyping to confirm the clonal nature of the cell. Subsequently, the functional capacity of that clone needs to be assessed <em>in vivo</em> to distinguish CSCs which are restricted to generating only cancer cells, from pHSCs and HSPCs which can produce all blood cells. Lineage tracing with cellular barcoding can allow us to track cells <em>in vivo</em> and in turn distinguish functional hematopoiesis from cancer. We are developing a unified method for lineage tracing and multi-omic profiling. We are using these techniques to develop stem cell specific clinical biomarker assays and implement mechanistic studies in CSC pathogenesis.</p>

			<p>Myeloid CSCs are poorly defined in myeloid cancers like <strong style="color:#404040ff">myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS)</strong>, <strong style="color:#404040ff">myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)</strong>, <strong style="color:#404040ff">systemic mastocytosis (SM)</strong>, and <strong style="color:#404040ff">chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)</strong>. We are currently applying our multi-omic single cell methods to study myeloid CSCs. Through collaborations with multiple clinical investigators at Stanford and beyond, we are acquiring pre and on-treatment samples from patients receiving standard and novel anti-cancer therapies. These samples are being profiled prospectively with the goal of defining the stem cell architecture across myeloid neoplasms on treatment using both single cell and bulk molecular profiling methods and functional hematologic assays. These new datasets will be integrated with our AML and healthy HSPC data (Project 1) to develop a function-based atlas of myeloid neoplasms, stem cell specific biomarker assays, and clinical decision-making tools (Project 3).</p>
